<summary>FPGA</summary>
 So what exactly is an FPGA? You may have heard the term thrown around, or maybe you have no idea what I'm talking about. Either way, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are amazing devices that now allow the average person to create their very own digital circuits. The cost has come down enough that you don't have to be a huge company to get your hands dirty.

You can think of an FPGA as a blank slate. By itself an FPGA does nothing. It is up to you (the designer) to create a configuration file, often called a bit file, for the FPGA. Once loaded the FPGA will behave like the digital circuit you designed!
